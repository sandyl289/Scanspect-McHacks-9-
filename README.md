Hi! This is the first time that we are using Google Vision API. So, to use our program, you will need Vision API keys, to download it and run it.

What you will need to do is:
> - run npm i
> - add vision key file
> - add uploads folder in the root directory

Thank you for trying our revolutionnary website!
